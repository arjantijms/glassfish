Embedded Server Guide

Release {product-majorVersion}

Contributed 2018 - 2024

This document explains how to run applications in embedded {productName} and to develop applications in which
{productName} is embedded. This document is for software developers
who are developing applications to run in embedded {productName}. The
ability to program in the Java language is assumed.

Note: The main thrust of the {productName} {product-majorVersion}
release is to provide an application server for developers to explore
and begin exploiting the new and updated technologies in the Jakarta EE 10
platform. Thus, the embedded server feature of {productName} was not
a focus of this release. This feature is included in the release, but it
may not function properly with some of the new features added in support
of the Jakarta EE 10 platform.
