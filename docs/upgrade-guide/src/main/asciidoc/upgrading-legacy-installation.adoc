== 1 Upgrading an Installation of Application Server or {productName}

This section explains how to upgrade to {productName} {product-majorVersion} from a previous version. The process involves replicating your existing configuration and applications in the new installation.

[[upgrade-paths]]
=== Upgrade Paths
Choose one of the following upgrade paths:

Side-by-Side (Recommended)::
Installs the new version in a separate directory, allowing you to test before switching to production. +
**Steps:**

1. Install {productName} {product-majorVersion} in a new directory.
2. Manually copy the configuration from the old installation.
3. Test the new installation.
4. Update your production environment to use the new installation.

In-Place (Not Recommended)::
  Replaces the existing installation. Requires manual steps and significant downtime. +
  **Steps:**

  1. Move the current installation to a backup directory.
  2. Install {productName} {product-majorVersion} in the original location.
  3. Manually copy the configuration from the backup.
  4. Test the new installation. If issues arise, restore the backup.

[[upgrade-procedure]]
=== Upgrade Procedure
Use the Upgrade Tool (`asadmin start-domain --upgrade`) to migrate configurations and applications.

==== Prerequisites
- Stop all domains on the source server.
- Install {productName} {product-majorVersion} (see {productName} Installation Guide).
- Copy custom/third-party libraries from the old installation to the new one.

==== Steps
1. **Install {productName} {product-majorVersion}** in a new directory.
2. **Copy configurations** from the old installation:
   - Domain directory (e.g., `glassfish/domains/domain1`)
   - Nodes directory (if applicable, e.g., `glassfish/nodes`)
3. **Run the Upgrade Tool**: `asadmin start-domain --upgrade``
4. **Start the upgraded domain**: `asadmin start-domain domain-name``
5. **Verify the upgrade** by logging into the Admin Console.

[[special-cases]]
=== Special Cases

[[upgrade-of-clusters]]

==== Upgrade of Clusters

When upgrading from a clustered configuration, the older cluster
information is retained in a new `domain.xml` file in the {productName} {product-majorVersion} installation directories. However, it is still necessary to
manually re-create the server instances that are contained in the
clusters.

To do that:

1. Perform new (not upgrade) {productName} {product-majorVersion} installations on each
node host. {productName} {product-majorVersion} installation instructions are provided
in the xref:installation-guide.adoc#GSING[
{productName} Installation Guide].

2. Correct the node configuration on the upgraded DAS, if necessary.
This procedure is described in xref:#correcting-cluster-config[Correcting Cluster configuration].

3. Start the upgraded DAS.
+
[source]
----
asadmin> start-domain domain-name
----
If the upgrade succeeded, the migrated cluster configuration exists and
the `get-health` subcommand lists the status of the clustered instances
as not running.

4. Confirm that the cluster configuration exists and contains all its instances.
+
[source]
----
asadmin> get-health cluster-name
----
For example, for the sample `cluster1` used in this procedure:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> get-health cluster1
instance1 not started
instance2 not started
Command get-health executed successfully.
----

5. Re-create the clustered server instances on each instance host. +
The specific commands to use depend on your configuration.

* If remote hosts cannot contact the DAS, export and import the
instances' configuration data, as explained in
"xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#to-resynchronize-an-instance-and-the-das-offline[
To Resynchronize an Instance and the DAS Offline]"
in {productName} High Availability Administration Guide.

* If remote hosts can contact the DAS, create each instance individually
and resynchronize the instance with the DAS, as explained in the
following sections:

** "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#to-create-an-instance-locally[
To Create an Instance Locally]"
in {productName} High Availability Administration Guide

** "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#to-resynchronize-an-instance-and-the-das-online[
To Resynchronize an Instance and the DAS Online]"
in {productName} High Availability Administration Guide +
Note that the node name matches that used for the node agent in the 2.x
installation. If you get an error stating that some attributes do not
match the values in the DAS configuration, follow the instructions in
xref:#correcting-cluster-config[Correcting Cluster configuration].

6. After creating the instances, manually copy the instance-dir``/imq``
directory for each instance from the older source installation to the
target {productName} {product-majorVersion} installation.

7. If necessary, start the cluster. +
For example:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> start-cluster cluster1
----
This step may or may not be necessary, depending on the procedure you
used to create the server instances for the cluster.

[[gkyin]]
Example 2-3 Creating Two Local Instances

The following example shows how to create two local instances in a
cluster.

[source]
----
host1$ asadmin --host dashost create-local-instance --node na1 --cluster cluster1 instance1
host2$ asadmin --host dashost create-local-instance --node na2 --cluster cluster1 instance2
----

`dashost`::
  The name of the DAS host.
`na1`::
  The name of the node host.
`cluster1`::
  The name of the cluster.
`instance1`, `instance2`::
  The names of the instances.

[[correcting-potential-upgrade-problems]]

[[correcting-cluster-config]]
==== Correcting Cluster configuration
{productName} {product-majorVersion} does not support node agents. If you're upgrading from a version that supports them or you have issues in cluster configuration after an upgrade, after upgrading the DAS:

1. **Install {productName} {product-majorVersion} on each node host**.
2. **Correct node configurations** using `update-node-config` or `update-node-ssh`.
3. **Re-create clusters and instances**:
   - Use `create-local-instance` for each instance.
   - Copy the `imq` directory from the old installation.

[[upgrading-installations-that-use-nss-cryptographic-tokens]]
==== Upgrading Installations Using NSS Cryptographic Tokens
{productName} {product-majorVersion} does not support NSS. If you're upgrading from a version that supports them, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare for Upgrade**:
   - Install {productName} {product-majorVersion} in a new directory.
   - Copy the source domain to the new installation.
   - Update `domain.xml` to remove NSS references and add JKS keystore paths.
2. **Perform Post-Upgrade Configuration**:
   - Migrate NSS keys to PKCS#12 using `keytool` and `certutil`.
   - Update the master password if needed.
3. **Upgrade PKCS#11 Hardware Tokens**:
   - Configure the token using JDK-JSSE mechanisms.
   - Update `domain.xml` to reference the hardware token.

[[troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting

==== Cluster Profile Security Setting
If upgrading from Application Server 9.1 or Enterprise Server v2, ensure the `admin-service` element in `domain.xml` has:
[source]
----
security-enabled=false
----
when `type=das-and-server`.

==== Common Issues
- **Cluster Profile Upgrade on Windows**: Ensure file paths use double backslashes (`\\`).
- **Upgrade Verification**: Check logs for errors and verify deployed applications.

[[terminology]]
=== Terminology
Source Domain Directory:: Directory of the domain being upgraded (e.g., `c:\glassfish\domains\domain1`).
Target Root Domain's Directory:: Directory where domains are created in the new installation (e.g., `c:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains`).
Master Password:: SSL certificate database password (default: `changeit`).
