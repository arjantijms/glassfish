Upgrade Guide

Release {product-majorVersion}

Contributed 2018 - 2024

This guide explains how to upgrade to {productName} {product-majorVersion}
from previous {productName} and Sun GlassFish Enterprise
Server product releases. Also included in this guide are instructions
for upgrading configuration data and Jakarta EE applications from
binary-compatible earlier versions of this software to work with
{productName} {product-majorVersion}. Finally, this guide describes
compatibility issues that affect data and applications that are to be
migrated.

Note: The main thrust of the {productName} {product-majorVersion}
release is to provide an application server for developers to explore
and begin exploiting the new and updated technologies in the Jakarta EE 10
platform. Thus, the upgrade feature of {productName} was not a focus
of this release. The feature is included in the release, but it may not
function properly with some of the new features added in support of the
Jakarta EE 10 platform.
