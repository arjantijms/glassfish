### November 30, 2023 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.11 Available

We are happy to announce the release of Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.11.

Download links are available from the [GlassFish Download page](download.md).

This release sees an important fix where WebSockets would not work at all for applications on the default context root (e.g. https://example.com vs https://example.com/myapp).

This month we have concentrated on the AdminGUI and fixed an assortment of small but annoying defects in it. Various major components were updated, such as Jersey (Jakarta REST), Tyrus (Jakarta WebSockets) and Mojarra (Jakarta Faces).

To keep the project maintainable and well tested, several tests were added and improved as well.

### October 29, 2023 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.10 Available

The GlassFish team is very happy to present you another great release of GlassFish.

Download links are available from the [GlassFish Download page](download.md).

In this release a 10 months long operation to get an internal dependency to the slf4j-api removed finally got to fruition. This involved the intense cooperation of multiple teams, and we're exceptionally happy to have finally been able to do this.

We also did a lot of work to make our builds repeatable, and we did a ton of refactoring to the internal security packages of GlassFish, making them easier to understand and therefore easier to maintain. Any external code depending on these internal packages (such as potentially custom LoginModules/Realms) may have to update (we recommend of course not depending on internal packages and using public APIs).

As every release, we integrated many component updates, and did a number of smaller fixes.

### September 29, 2023 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.9 Available

We're happy to present you with the latest GlassFish release.

Download links are available from the [GlassFish Download page](download.md).

In this release the modularity of GlassFish is once again increased by moving the Jakarta Authentication implementation code to a new standalone project: [Epicyro](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/epicyro). We also enabled the GlassFish embedded tests again, which were dormant for a long time. Among the many updated components, Exousia was updated specifically to fix a bug with deployments on virtual servers, and the ORB was updated to fix a somewhat obscure bug where a remote EJB returned a JDK defined enum type.

### August 28, 2023 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.8 Available

The entire GlassFish team is happy to present you another great GlassFish release.

Download links are available from the [GlassFish Download page](download.md).

This release fixes multi-jar compatibility in GlassFish and does further preparations for JDK 21. It includes various component updates among which those for CDI, Faces, and JSON. Test coverage is improved by adding the TCKs for REST Client and Connectors. Finally, various CDI extensions have been optimised to reduce excessive and unnecessary calls to them.

### July 29, 2023 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.7 Available

Another month, another new version of Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.7 released today.

This release also adds support for MicroProfile JWT 2.1, and has many components updated to their latest version. Several issues have again been fixed in the Admin Console. An important bug regarding Enterprise Beans method generation has been fixed, as has a remote access issue for Enterprise Beans.

The main features of this release are the updates of various components, fixing a wide array of issues. Specifically with WaSP 3.2.0 a major change is that it now includes the Pages Standard Tags, so the separate jar for this is no longer present in GlassFish. We also fixed an important regression where requesting a directory from the ClassLoader failed for exploded deploys. This now works again. Additionally the version (7.0.2 now) is reported correctly again, which can be important for package managers such as brew.
