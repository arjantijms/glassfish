NAME
       stop-cluster - stops a GlassFish Server cluster

SYNOPSIS
        stop-cluster
        [--help|-?]
        [--kill[=<kill(default:false)>]]
        [--timeout <timeout>]
        clustername

DESCRIPTION
       The stop-cluster subcommand stops a GlassFish Server cluster by
       stopping all running GlassFish Server instances in the cluster.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --verbose
           Specifies whether additional progress messages about the status of
           instances in the cluster are displayed while the cluster is being
           stopped.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               Additional progress messages about the status of instances in
               the cluster are displayed.

           false
               No messages about the status of instances in the cluster are
               displayed.

       --kill
           Specifies whether each instance in the cluster is killed by using
           functionality of the operating system to terminate the instance
           process.

           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               No instances are killed. The subcommand uses functionality of
               the Java platform to terminate each instance process (default).

           true
               Each instance is killed. The subcommand uses functionality of
               the operating system to terminate each instance process.

       --timeout
            Specifies timeout in seconds to evaluate the expected result.
            If the timeout is exceeded, the command fails - however it does
            not mean it did not make any changes. The status of instances is
            unknown in such case.

OPERANDS
       cluster-name
           The name of the cluster to stop.

EXAMPLES

           messages about the status of instances in the cluster are displayed
