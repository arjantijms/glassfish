start-cluster(1)          asadmin Utility Subcommands         start-cluster(1)

NAME
       start-cluster - starts a cluster

SYNOPSIS
        start-cluster
        [--debug[=<debug(default:false)>]]
        [--help|-?]
        [--timeout <timeout>]
        [--verbose[=<verbose(default:false)>]]
        clustername

DESCRIPTION
       The start-cluster subcommand starts a cluster by starting all GlassFish
       Server instances in the cluster that are not already running. This
       subcommand requires the secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the host
       where the domain administration server (DAS) is running and on all
       hosts where instances in the cluster reside.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           If all instances reside on   |
           |           the same host as the DAS,    |
           |           SSH is not required. You     |
           |           might require to start a     |
           |           cluster in which instances   |
           |           reside on hosts where        |
           |           SSH is not configured        |
           |           that are remote from the     |
           |           DAS. In this situation, run  |
           |           the start-local-instance(1)  |
           |           subcommand for each instance |
           |           from the host where the      |
           |           instance resides.            |
           +----------------------------------------+

       You may run this subcommand from any host that can contact the DAS.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --debug
           Specifies whether each instance in the cluster is started with Java Platform
           Debugger Architecture (JPDA)

           (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/jpda/jpda.html)

           debugging enabled.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               Each instance is started with JPDA debugging enabled and the
               port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

           false
               Each instance is started with JPDA debugging disabled (default).

       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --timeout
            Specifies timeout in seconds to evaluate the expected result.
            If the timeout is exceeded, the command fails - however it does
            not mean it did not make any changes. The status of instances is
            unknown in such case.

       --verbose
           Specifies whether additional status information is displayed when
           the cluster is started.

           Valid values are as follows:

           true
               Displays the command to start each instance in the cluster and
               whether the attempt to start each instance succeeded.

           false
               Displays no additional status information (default).

OPERANDS
       cluster-name
           The name of the cluster to start.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Staring a Cluster
           This example starts the cluster ymlcluster. Additional status
           information is displayed when the cluster is started.

               asadmin> start-cluster --verbose ymlcluster
               start-instance yml-i-sr1-usca-02
               start-instance yml-i-sr1-usca-01

               The command start-instance executed successfully for:
               yml-i-sr1-usca-02 yml-i-sr1-usca-01

               Command start-cluster executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
